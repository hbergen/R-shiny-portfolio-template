# Project B

This is a **placeholder** page for a future project. 



***

**I have chosen this data to power this future project:**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
